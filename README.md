# StackOverflow-Assistant

<p> In this project, I have used various Natural Language Processing techniques to construct a dialogue chat bot, which: </p>
<ul>

    <li> answer programming-related questions (using StackOverflow dataset) </li>
    <li> chit-chat and simulate dialogue on all non programming-related questions (used a pre-trained neural network engine available from ChatterBot)</li> 
</ul>
<p>
The bot responds to the question asked with the most relevant Stack-Overflow Link.</p>
<p>
To find a relevant answer on a question, vector representations are used to calculate similarity between the question and existing threads. </p>
<p> The bot is deployed on Amazon EC2. </p>
